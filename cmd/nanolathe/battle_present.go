// The asynchronous window's presentation clock (docs/DESIGN_GPU_RENDERER.md
// §13.5, §13.13).
//
// The window presents one continuous world time T, in ticks, that trails the
// tick budget's own clock by a lag:
//
//	T(t) = F + carry + (t − t_F) × rate − lag − margin × rate
//
// F is the global tick after the last host step's release, carry the budget's
// remainder just after it [01 §4.2] and t_F that step's IDEAL host millisecond,
// the instant the window's 30 Hz host clock meant it for; rate is 30 × the
// effective speed (active × 0.1 [01 §4.2]) ticks per second. Every prepared
// host step rebases F + carry, including one that released nothing, so a speed
// change moves the rate from the step it took effect. The presented pair is
// the tick after floor(T) and the tick before it, blended at T's fraction, so
// every presented frame moves the world by the wall time since the last one,
// at whatever speed and however many ticks a host step releases.
//
// A step's body runs when the window gets to it, which trails the ideal
// instant by anything from nothing to a refresh or two: a step lands on the
// Update nearest its instant, and a modern window runs the body at a Draw's
// tail, a refresh later again when a cap skips the Draw in between (§13.10).
// Rebased at the body, every change in that lateness moved T by the same
// amount — at 60 FPS on a 120 Hz panel a dropped refresh swapped the bodies
// between the two Draws of a present interval, and the world held for a
// refresh and then leapt one, over and over while the panel dropped refreshes.
// Rebased at the ideal instant, T is a function of wall time alone. What the
// lateness still decides is when the batch T needs is joined, so the margin
// holds T back by the lateness recently seen (presentMarginCeiling).
//
// Measured from one tick instead, as the blend used to be, a host step that
// released two ticks presented only the second: at 2x the world eased across
// the older tick in half a step, held for the other half, and leapt the tick
// it never showed — a third of a tick, then one and two-thirds, frame after
// frame. Any speed above 1x did a version of the same.

// its own length would hide, and which must not leave the world lagging a
// stall behind for seconds afterwards.
//
// presentMarginRelease is how fast, in milliseconds per host millisecond, the
// margin gives back lateness that has stopped recurring: a refresh's worth in
// two seconds, so the world runs under one percent fast while it does. Dropped
// refreshes come in bursts: replaying a traced fullscreen session's timing, a
// margin released at the lag's own rate (presentLagEase) left twice the world
// motion errors over 4 ms that this one does (95 against 49 in two minutes).

// the budget clock runs from B = F + carry to B + k, k being the ticks the
// budget accrues per step (active / 10), and T must stay at or below F − K =
// floor(B − k). That holds when lag ≥ 2k + the carry the previous step kept.
// A speed's carries are multiples of gcd(active, 10) / 10, so the largest is
// 1 − gcd(active, 10) / 10 and the lag is 2k plus that. At the nominal speed
