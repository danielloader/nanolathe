// The carrier staging image [R-REN-03A §4].
//
// Retail does not blit a carrier and then paint its children over the top.
// Presentation of a unit that has attached children takes one of two paths,
// chosen on whether the carrier's own composition image has a key plane:
//
//   - **No key plane.** The cached image is blitted, and then every live piece
//     and every attached child is rasterized straight to the framebuffer in
//     painter order. Nothing resolves per pixel because there is no plane to
//     resolve against.
//   - **Key plane present.** A staging image is prepared whose box is the union
//     of the carrier's own box with the boxes of all its attached children,
//     offset by each child's world position relative to the carrier. The cached
//     image is copied into it, both planes. Each child is then composed into its
//     own two-plane image and composited into the staging image with the key
//     test, at the child's pixel offset and with the child's world-height
//     difference added to every key it contributes. The waterline and digger
//     passes run over the staging image, and the staging image is blitted once.
//
// The consequence is per-pixel occlusion between a carrier and its cargo: a
// transport's hull can stand in front of the unit it is carrying, and a
// factory's plate in front of the nanoframe on it, because the two resolve
// against one height plane rather than by draw order.

// stagingChild is one attached child ready to be composited: its finished
// composition — reveal and nanoframe outline already applied to its own image
// [R-COMP-01 §3] — and the key offset that puts its heights on the carrier's
// scale.
