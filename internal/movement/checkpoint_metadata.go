// These records describe existing retained callbacks; none is read by gameplay.
// DESIGN_MULTIPLAYER §16.3.5–§16.3.6 owns their checkpoint disposition. Opening
// a search records operands once, alongside the callbacks [04 R-PATH-01 §4].
// Resumption keeps them even when the requester or its current rules change.
// A dropped working set drops its roots [04 R-PATH-01 §6]. No capture operation
// calls a rule, callback, layer revision or search method to discover operands.

// checkpointClaimRow is a comparable identity for one actual backing row in
// table 7. kind is retained as the union tag: 1 own, 2 counts. Exactly one of
// own/counts is the retained row for that tag; the other is nil. The holder is
// attached where its row is allocated, never reconstructed or copied during
// checkpointing. Recounts and serial wrap mutate the same row. Replacement
// allocates a new holder, leaving an old search's row reachable through its
// captured holder (DESIGN_MOVEMENT_PATH "Modern route claims").
// Slice capacity is allocation detail; the complete logical row is retained.

// checkpointAccessorCapture is one construction-time node before object IDs
// exist. value retains the meaningful scalar operands of its published kind;
// its Inputs and four object-ID fields stay nil/zero until checkpoint lowering.
// inputs retains ordered graph edges, not discarded intermediate choices.
// layer resolves to table 5; learned plus learnedOwner resolves to the canonical
// learned grid's owner+1 operand; counts/own resolve independently to table 7.
// system is the actual hostile/keeps-ground receiver, validated against the
// composed owner; its live world/alliance ports are not frozen here. registry
// and class retain the revision callback's real lookup operands for validation
// against layer. They are checked bindings, not additional serialized objects.
// Scalar disposition by kind (all other value fields remain zero):
//   - class: Requester, Owner, copied Profile, Tick, raw FootprintX/Z;
//   - learned: raw FootprintX/Z, plus learned/learnedOwner above;
//   - through: Owner, raw FootprintX/Z and the selected Through;
//   - static: raw FootprintX/Z, plus layer above;
//   - wall: Owner and Wall (hostile 1, keeps-ground 2), plus system above;
//   - wedge: Start, strict Bounds and raw FootprintX/Z;
//   - claims: Owner, Serial, Width/Height, clamped FootprintX/Z, resolved
//     Per/Against and Row (all 2, slow 3), plus counts/own above;
//   - revision: copied Profile, Requester and Tick, plus layer/registry/class.
//
// The profile's eight operands are widened exactly to the published int32
// descriptor fields. None of these pointer identities is serialized as an
// address. All other mutable data reachable through them belongs to its
// existing state owner.
