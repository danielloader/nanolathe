// Package labrules is the pathfinding laboratory's list of movement policies
// (docs/PATHFINDING_LAB.md): the baseline every measurement was made
// against, the policy Modern adopted, and between them the rungs of the
// ladder that led from one to the other, each as it was measured.
//
// A set is a movement policy and a search kernel. It is not a rule set: the
// laboratory's replay (internal/pathlab), the AI arena and the path
// benchmark each register the list under their own registry entries, and
// the game links none of them. The package imports nothing above the
// movement system, so that the session's own benchmark tests can read it.
