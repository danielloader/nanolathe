# Source installer

The public alpha installer builds the latest commit on `main` on the player's
computer. It downloads a private Go toolchain and dependencies, creates a
shortcut, and starts the game. Original Total Annihilation assets are supplied
by the player. This is Nanolathe host installation policy, not retail behavior.

## Install and update

Mac or Linux, in Terminal:

```sh
curl -fsSL https://nanolathe.gg/install.sh | bash
```

Windows x64 or ARM64, in PowerShell:

```powershell
& ([scriptblock]::Create((irm https://nanolathe.gg/install.ps1)))
```

The shortcut checks the latest commit on `main` at launch. If it
differs from the installed release, it offers **Update & play**
or **Play current version**. The check has a short timeout; an unavailable or
invalid response leaves the installed game usable. Declining the update also
starts the current build. Downloads and compilation only happen after accepting
an update, or when you run the install command yourself.

An accepted update verifies the downloaded installer against the manifest's
SHA-256 before running it. It reuses the existing compiler and build cache,
installs into the same user directory, then launches the selected release.
Build or verification failures leave the previous build selected. Saves and
settings are outside the versioned release directories.

On Mac, accepting an update from the app opens a native progress window with
an activity bar and the current download, verification, build or installation
stage. Compilation has no reliable percentage or time estimate; the window
stays active until the updater finishes, then closes before the game launches.
Terminal launches print the same stages. The progress window uses macOS's
built-in scripting runtime and adds no compiler or application dependency.

**Upgrading the first alpha:** rerun the install command once to replace the
original shortcut launcher with one that checks for updates. You can also close
the game and rerun that command whenever you want to update manually.

Supported installer targets: Mac Intel/Apple Silicon (macOS 13 or newer),
Linux x86-64/ARM64, and Windows x64/ARM64. Linux requires a graphical desktop and the window-system, graphics,
and audio runtime libraries used by Ebitengine. Go alone builds the desktop
engine; a separate C compiler is not required. The Windows installer selects a native compiler and engine for the host CPU,
including when PowerShell itself runs under x64 emulation on ARM64.

These builds have no paid publisher signature. Locally building the game does
not override OS execution policies. The ordinary Windows SmartScreen dialog may
offer **More info → Run anyway**; Smart App Control and managed-device policies
can block it without that option. The installers do not change security policy.

## Files and shortcuts

| Platform | Default installation directory | Shortcut |
|---|---|---|
| Mac | `~/Library/Application Support/Nanolathe` | `~/Applications/Nanolathe.app` |
| Linux | `$XDG_DATA_HOME/nanolathe`, or `~/.local/share/nanolathe` | `$XDG_DATA_HOME/applications/nanolathe.desktop`, or `~/.local/share/applications/nanolathe.desktop` |
| Windows | `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Nanolathe` | Nanolathe in the user's Start Menu |

The Mac app and Windows Start Menu shortcut use the Nanolathe website's green
N mark. Their icons, and the Mac update-window script, are copied from the
resolved source commit; they require no separate download. Every successful
install or update refreshes the existing Mac app bundle or Windows shortcut.
The Windows icon stays in its installed release directory, so deleting the
temporary download and build files cannot remove it.

Within the installation directory:

- `saves`: newly written `.SAV` files.
- `settings.json`: launcher-specific preferences.
- `logs`: installation and game diagnostics.
- `releases`: versioned builds, each with the toolchain `release.txt` manifest and actual `source-revision`.
- `toolchains` and `cache`: private Go installation, dependencies, and build cache.
- Unix `current` symlink or Windows `current.txt`: selected release.
- Unix `game-root` or Windows `root.txt`: the remembered game-data directory.

The launcher validates and explicitly selects one content root. Several detected
installations require a selection; they are not automatically overlaid. Missing
or moved data triggers selection again. Mac app launches use a native picker;
Terminal/Linux launches can prompt in the terminal; Windows offers a folder
picker. Starting the installed `nanolathe` executable directly, without the
shortcut, also uses the remembered folder while it still holds game data.
`--check-install` validates startup mounts and required products, not
every asset in the game. A later content error is recorded in the game log.

When reporting a problem, attach the run log from `logs` (or paste the startup
lines and the error). Startup records the build/source revision, OS and CPU
architecture, Go runtime, content profile/mod, archive counts and provider
precedence, map count and skipped maps, effective game/display settings, load
times, heap allocation, graphics backend and configured audio rate. The source
revision comes from `source-revision` when VCS metadata is absent, falling
back to the release manifest for older installations.
Rejected archives and unreadable maps include their provider names. More than
ten HPI archives is valid and does not produce a warning. Manual launches write
these diagnostics to standard error; capture them with `2>nanolathe.log`.

Existing retail saves and manual-build settings are not moved or overwritten.
To import a save, copy its `.SAV` file into the new `saves` directory with the
game closed. Save compatibility remains a work in progress. The launcher passes
`--save-dir` and `NANOLATHE_SETTINGS`; manual engine launches preserve their
existing defaults unless given overrides.

## Options

To install without launching or selecting game data:

```sh
curl -fsSL https://nanolathe.gg/install.sh | bash -s -- --no-run
```

```powershell
& ([scriptblock]::Create((irm https://nanolathe.gg/install.ps1))) -NoRun
```

Pass `--root "/path/to/TotalAnnihilation"` on Unix or
`-Root 'C:\Games\Total Annihilation'` on Windows to select a folder explicitly.
Unix validates and remembers an explicit root during installation, including
with `--no-run`; Windows applies `-Root` when launching, so omit `-NoRun` when
selecting data. Set `NANOLATHE_INSTALL_DIR` to an absolute path to choose another
installation directory. It does not change the shortcut location.

On Unix, `<installation directory>/launch.sh --root PATH` changes the remembered
folder without rebuilding. Removing the remembered-root file on either platform
makes the next launch select again. Deleting a stale Unix `.install-lock`
directory is appropriate only after confirming no installer is still running.

## Remove

Close the game, remove its shortcut, and delete the installation directory.
Copy out any saves/settings you want to keep first. This removes the private
compiler and cache too. The original TA installation remains separate.

## Release maintenance

The canonical scripts live here; the website serves byte-for-byte copies as
`/install.sh` and `/install.ps1`. A website-owned `/install/release.txt` records a
legacy source snapshot and pins the Go patch version, per-platform Go archive
hashes, and public installer hashes.
Installers resolve current `main` once and fetch its immutable archive over
GitHub HTTPS, recording the commit in `source-revision`; the legacy source
archive hashes do not verify current-main downloads. Manifest data is never
evaluated as code. Downloads use HTTPS; hashes pin the expected bytes but are not
a separate publisher signature.

1. Integrate changes and run `tools/check`, `tools/check-retail`, and the native
   **Source installer** CI workflow. Offline tests run with
   `python3 tools/installer/test_install.py` and
   `powershell -NoProfile -File tools/installer/test-install.ps1`.
2. Push the tested engine commit. In the website checkout, run
   `python3 scripts/prepare-source-release.py --sync-installers --engine /path/to/nanolathe --revision FULL_COMMIT --version RELEASE_LABEL --go-version GO_PATCH`.
   It checks public archive scripts against that local commit and reads official
   Go checksums. Review the scripts and manifest together.
3. Push the website changes to a review branch. Dispatch the engine's
   **Source installer** workflow with that branch's raw HTTPS manifest URL to
   test actual toolchain download and installation on native runners. These
   checks omit game launch and require no retail data.
4. On a desktop with retail assets, run the installer, select data, start a
   battle, and check saving/loading. A successful compiler run alone does not
   establish a playable installation. Check platform-specific shortcuts and
   folder selection on the platforms being promoted.
5. Run website `make check` and publish its reviewed commit. This refreshes the
   public installer scripts and their checksums. Future installs and launch-time
   update checks resolve engine `main`; new main commits need no manifest change.
   Prior builds stay installed until the user removes them.

The first install has a cold compiler/dependency cache, so measure its time
separately from updates. No first-install duration is promised.
